# Atom-Editor-Setup
Feel free to use my setup for your own.
I do use this Repo from now on as a backup.

I was bored to always update my Atom Settings and Packages on different devices.
So I decided to use a repo to update every instance at once from everywhere.

The structure is different for every folder.
Since I am planning on using different settings and packages for different languages.

You will find other useful files too in the programming-language folders.

Enjoy!


To backup all packages in a list use this:

Package List
You use the following:

`apm list --installed --bare > package-list.txt`

to create your package list and then

`apm install --packages-file package-list.txt`

to install them.

You can find my package-list in the atom folder or if I have done it
for the specific programming language. I usally do alot of stuff in JavaScript so my main atom folder will hold the JavaScript stuff too.
